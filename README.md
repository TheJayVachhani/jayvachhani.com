## Forking this repo

This is my website that I have built from scratch. I have found inspiration, as one does, from a great many sources. I would welcome people to use this as inspiration as well.

Given that _**plagiarism is a bit sketchy**_, If you want to use this as a template, I would suggest that you star the repo and simply give a cheeky link back to this repo as credit.

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please add a cheeky credit by linking back to [jayvachhani.tech](https://jayvachhani.tech). Thanks!
